4a:
    • Created fuzz.py for py_parser.py
        ◦ Learned how to fuzz methods which helps to identify weaknesses in code for more robust, secure code by generating many random, corrupt inputs which could be exploited by the wrong users.
    • Created a GitHub action
        ◦ Learned to create a GitHub action to run and store the results of fuzz.py on every commit which helps to create a secure software process.

4b:
    • Added Logging to py_parser.py
        ◦ Learned to use logging to add forensics which can help trace or observe a programs functionality which adds security and can even make it easier to debug.
